# DataStructures

This repository contains core data structures and algorithms implemented in **C++ from scratch**, as part of my coursework at **Texas A&M University (TAMU)**.  
It aims to mimic the functionality of **C++ STL** (Standard Template Library) with custom logic and clean design principles.

---

## Highlights

- Implemented fundamental data structures without relying on built-in STL containers.
- Focused on performance, memory management, and object-oriented design.
- Demonstrated understanding of algorithmic complexity and edge case handling.

---

## Implemented Structures

- **Linked List** (doubly)
- **Dynamic Array (Vector-like)**
- **Stacks & Queues**
- **Binary Search Tree**
- **Hash Tables**
- **Graphs and Graph Algorithms** (BFS, DFS)
- **Priority Queue (Heap-based)**


---

## Key Concepts Applied

- Templates and generic programming
- Operator overloading
- Memory allocation and pointer management
- Encapsulation and class design
- Recursion and divide & conquer strategies

## Why This Project Matters

This project demonstrates my ability to:
- Build efficient, low-level data structures without libraries.
- Think critically about software design, performance, and reusability.
- Work independently on complex problems with real-world applicability.

Employers can review this repository to assess my **C++ proficiency, algorithmic thinking**, and understanding of data structures — which are foundational to backend development, systems programming, and technical interviews.

## ⚠️ Academic Integrity Notice

This repository contains coursework I completed as part of my education at **TAMU**.

The code is shared **strictly for portfolio purposes** to demonstrate my understanding of data structures.  
**Do not copy or submit this code for academic credit.**

If you are a student in a similar course, I encourage you to develop your own solutions to preserve the value of your learning.
